This was part of a Data Analysis Project for Intro to Computation Physics 2024. The objective for this project
was to analyze oil prices since 1974, plot the data in some way, and then write a project report using latex.
All of this had to be associated with this github repository as well. The most code-heavy portion was probably just
the file reading the text file with all the original data and then plotting it.
